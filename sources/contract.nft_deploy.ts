/*
    (Remember to install dependencies by running "yarn install" in the terminal)
    Here are the instructions to deploy the contract:
    1. Create new walletV4r2 or use existing one.
    2. Enter your mnemonics in .env file.
    3. On line 35 select the network you want to deploy the contract.
    (// - comments out the line, so you can switch between networks)
    (testnet is chosen by default, if you are not familiar with it, read https://tonkeeper.helpscoutdocs.com/article/100-how-switch-to-the-testnet)
    4. Change content according to standard https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0064-token-data-standard.md 
    5. Run "yarn build" to compile the contract.
    6. Run this script by "yarn deploy"
